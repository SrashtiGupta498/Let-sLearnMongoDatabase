## MongoDB Basics

**What is MongoDB?**

MongoDB is a general-purpose, open-source, NoSQL document database designed for modern application development and cloud environments. Unlike traditional relational databases that use tables and rows, MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, allowing for dynamic and unstructured data storage[1][2][5][6].

---

**Key Concepts**

- **Database**: A container for collections, similar to a database in relational systems[4].
- **Collection**: The equivalent of a table in relational databases. Collections store documents and do not enforce a schema, so documents within a collection can have different fields[2][6].
- **Document**: The basic unit of data in MongoDB, represented as a set of key-value pairs (similar to JSON objects, but stored internally as BSON—Binary JSON)[2][6]. Documents can contain nested documents and arrays, offering great flexibility.

**Example Document**

```json
{
  "title": "Post Title 1",
  "body": "Body of post.",
  "category": "News",
  "likes": 1,
  "tags": ["news", "events"],
  "date": "2025-06-10T22:06:00Z"
}
```
This document could be stored in a collection called `posts`[2].

---

**Basic Operations (CRUD)**

| Operation | Description | Example Command |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Create    | Insert new documents into a collection | `db.posts.insertOne({title: "New Post"})` |
| Read      | Query documents from a collection | `db.posts.find({category: "News"})` |
| Update    | Modify existing documents | `db.posts.updateOne({title: "New Post"}, {$set: {likes: 2}})` |
| Delete    | Remove documents from a collection | `db.posts.deleteOne({title: "New Post"})` |

These commands are executed in the MongoDB shell or through drivers in various programming languages[5][4].

---

**Data Modeling**

MongoDB’s schema-less nature allows you to model data in a way that best fits your application. You can embed related data in documents (nesting) or reference other documents, depending on your needs[3][6]. This flexibility is especially useful for handling complex or evolving data structures.

---

**Indexes and Performance**

MongoDB supports various types of indexes (single field, compound, multikey, text, hashed) to optimize query performance. Every document has a unique `_id` field that acts as its primary key[5].

---

**Scalability and High Availability**

MongoDB is built for scalability and high availability:
- **Sharding**: Distributes data across multiple servers for horizontal scaling[5].
- **Replication**: Maintains multiple copies of data for redundancy and failover.

---

**Common Use Cases**

- Content management systems
- Real-time analytics
- Internet of Things (IoT) applications
- Catalogs and inventory management[7]

---

**Getting Started**

- Install MongoDB on your system (Windows, MacOS, Linux)[4].
- Use the MongoDB shell (`mongosh`) or MongoDB Compass (GUI) for database operations[4][5].
- Start by creating a database, adding collections, and inserting documents.

**Summary Table: MongoDB vs Relational Databases**

| Feature            | MongoDB (NoSQL)     | Relational DB (SQL)      |
|--------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Data Structure     | Documents (BSON)    | Tables (Rows & Columns)  |
| Schema             | Flexible/Schema-less| Fixed Schema             |
| Joins              | Limited/Manual      | Built-in                 |
| Scalability        | Horizontal (Sharding)| Vertical (Scaling up)    |
| Transactions       | Supported (since v4)| Supported                |

MongoDB is a powerful, flexible database well-suited for modern, data-driven applications that require scalability and rapid development[1][2][5][6].
